# 🧠 Intelligent Crime Detection Using Artificial Intelligence

## 📌 Project Overview

**Intelligent Crime Detection Using AI** is an advanced surveillance system that detects potential violence in real-time using motion tracking, face detection, and alert mechanisms. Built with Python, OpenCV, and deep learning, the system captures video streams, detects suspicious movement and faces, and generates alerts, while maintaining logs in both CSV and Excel formats.
